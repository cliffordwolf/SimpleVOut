SimpleVOut -- A Simple FPGA Core for Creating VGA/DVI/HDMI/OpenLDI Signals
==========================================================================

SimpleVOut (SVO) is a simple set of FPGA cores for creating video signals
in various formats. The cores connect using AXI-streams. Most configurations
(resolution, framerate, colordepth, etc.) are set at compile-time using
Verilog parameters. See svo_defines.vh for details on those parameters.

This directory contains:

    svosrc/
      This is the actual SVO sourcecode. If you use SVO simply copy this
      directory into your project.

    vivado_ip/
      An example Vivado IP wrapper (simplehdmi) for SVO. This IP provides a
      video DMA and a simple terminal overlay and creates DVI/HDMI signals.

    zybo_vl/
      An example design using SVO for the Zybo Board (Xilinx Vivado). This
      example is written in Verilog HDL.

    zybo_bd/
      An example Vivado block-design using the IPs from vivado_ip/.

The svosrc/ directory contains the following cores for outputing video
streams in different formats (see zybo_vl/system.v for usage examples):

    svo_enc.v
      The video "encoder". Other frameworks call this component a video
      timings generator. The output of this core can be fed directly
      into a DAC to create a VGA signal.

    svo_openldi.v
      This takes the svo_enc-output and creates an OpenLDI (aka LVDS)
      video signal.

    svo_tmds.v
      This takes the svo_enc-output and creates a DVI/HDMI video signal.

The following cores can be used to create video streams:

    svo_tcard.v
      This core generates a static test card.

    svo_pong.v
      A little pong game. This is implemented as video overlay, so it
      is perfect as an easter-egg for your design.

    svo_term.v
      A text terminal. Only stores the last N (default=2048) characters
      and scrolls when running out of character memory. Good for
      dislaying debug information (such as early boot messages).

    svo_vdma.v
      A video DMA controller. Has a read-only AXI4 master interface to
      access the video memory.

See also svo_utils.v for various helpers for combining video streams. The
svo_pong core is in fact a collection of various cores generating video
overlays that are combined using the helper modules from svo_utils.v. So
have a look at svo_pong.v for usage examples for the stuff in svo_utils.v.
